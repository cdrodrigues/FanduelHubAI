# FandulHubAI

This project demonstrates how to load and interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) using Hugging Face's `transformers` library in a Jupyter Notebook. The example uses the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model and provides code and instructions for setting up prompts and running chat-based interactions.

## Features
- Load and use the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model from Hugging Face
- Example of prompt engineering for documentation Q&A
- Step-by-step code in a Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open `LLM.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Follow the notebook cells to load the model, set up prompts, and interact with the LLM.

## Dependencies
- transformers
- torch
- tensorflow >= 2.0
- sentencepiece
